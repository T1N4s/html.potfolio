<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Paw Patrol</h3>
<p>One of Sarah's favorite movies.</p>
<h3>Hotel Transilvania</h3>
<p>I find it very funny when Dracula eats garlic sauce and ask if the Captain have farted.</p>
<h3>Raining burguers 2 (Not sure if that's the name)</h3>
<p>Berry is my favourite character. I find their language cute.</p>
